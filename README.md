# AjaxFileSender
Send Files from a Form via Ajax using JQuery (miltiple files and client base type checking included)

Welcome to my first public and openSource Project.

In this project i want to send files from a html form with JavaScript via Ajax to a PHP script. It supports multiple file selection and checks for the file-types. It's based on JQuery 2.1.3 and works fine for Windows 8.1 with IE10, FireFox and Chrome (2015-08-01).

Requirements:
You need to download the JQuery and save as public_html/js/libs/jquery/jquery.min.js or you change the including line in the index.html to the correct file.

All files you need are in the public_html folder. Feel free to build your Ajax File Forms and let me know if there are any issues with the script.
